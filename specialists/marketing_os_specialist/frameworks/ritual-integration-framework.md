# Ritual Integration Framework
## Behavioral Design • Cultural Integration • Product-Service Architecture

## 1. Ritual-First Philosophy

```yaml
core_principles:
  products_as_anchors: "behavioral_anchors_not_purchases"
  design_priorities:
    - ritual_adoption_over_transaction
    - sequence_timing_over_features
    - feedback_loops_over_effects
    - consistent_usage_over_initial_purchase
    
  success_metrics:
    primary: [ritual_completion_rate, timing_compliance, sequence_adherence]
    secondary: [outcome_achievement, data_validation, ecosystem_expansion]
    avoid: [one_time_purchase_volume, feature_appreciation_without_usage]
```

## 2. Product Category Ritual Architecture

```yaml
ritual_categories:
  sleep_protocol:
    anchor_point: "evening_wind_down"
    data_feedback: [sleep_score, hrv, rem_deep_percentages]
    complementary: [zennya_ring, environment, evening_protocols]
    sequence_position: "final_evening_step"
    
  recovery_protocol:
    anchor_point: "post_exertion_window"
    data_feedback: [recovery_rate, inflammation_markers, readiness]
    complementary: [hydration, massage, compression]
    sequence_position: "immediate_post_activity"
    
  energy_protocol:
    anchor_point: "morning_activation"
    data_feedback: [sustained_energy, afternoon_metrics]
    complementary: [nutrition_timing, movement, stress_management]
    sequence_position: "initial_daily_step"
    
  foundational_protocol:
    anchor_point: "daily_baseline_support"
