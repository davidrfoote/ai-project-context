# Meeting Intelligence Agent: Product Specification

## Product Overview

### Vision
Transform every meeting from a time sink into a productivity multiplier by creating an AI agent that actively participates, ensures clarity, provides context, and guarantees follow-through.

### Mission
Build an intelligent meeting assistant that eliminates the three biggest meeting problems:
1. Unclear action items and ownership
2. Lost context and repeated discussions
3. Poor follow-through and accountability

### Target Users
- **Primary**: Knowledge workers who attend 5+ meetings per week
- **Secondary**: Team leads and project managers
- **Tertiary**: Executives who need meeting intelligence at scale

## Core Value Propositions

### For Meeting Participants
"Never miss an action item, never forget what was decided, always have context"

### For Team Leaders
"Ensure every meeting drives progress with clear outcomes and accountability"

### For Organizations
"Transform meetings from necessary evils into engines of productivity"

## Key Features

### 1. Intelligent Meeting Preparation

#### Participant Intelligence
```
Before each meeting, the agent knows:
- Who each participant is (role, expertise, communication style)
- Their current projects and priorities
- Past commitments and completion rates
- Relevant context from previous interactions
```

#### Meeting Context Assembly
```
- Related past meetings and decisions
- Pending action items from participants
- Relevant documents and discussions
- Project status and timelines
```

#### Proactive Agenda Enhancement
```
- Suggests objectives if missing
- Identifies required decisions
- Flags potential conflicts
- Recommends optimal duration
```

### 2. Real-Time Meeting Intelligence

#### Active Participation Features

**Action Item Clarification**
```
Detected: "John will look into the pricing issue"
Agent: "I'd like to clarify this action item:
- Specific deliverable?
- Due date?
- Success criteria?"
```

**Context Surfacing**
```
Participant: "What did we decide about the API structure?"
Agent: "On March 15, the team decided on RESTful API with these endpoints...
[Shows relevant decision with link to full context]"
```

**Conflict Detection**
```
Participant: "Let's launch on Friday"
Agent: "Note: Friday is the production freeze for Q4 release. 
Alternative dates: Dec 12 or Jan 5"
```

**Fact Checking**
```
Participant: "We tried this last year and it failed"
Agent: "I found the Q2 2023 initiative - it actually improved conversion by 23%.
Perhaps you're thinking of the Q4 2022 test?"
```

**Expertise Routing**
```
Discussion: Complex authentication issue
Agent: "Sarah implemented similar authentication 3 times. 
She's available 2-4pm today. Should I invite her?"
