Product Playbook: Smart Sleep Stack
Product Playbook: Smart Sleep Stack (v2 – Closed Loop Enhanced)
Health Behavior Engine • Outcome Tracking • Insight-Driven Ritualization
1. Purpose & Strategic Role
The Smart Sleep Stack transforms sleep from a passive observation into a personalized, data-driven ritual system. It serves as
Zennya’s first fully verticalized behavioral OS loop—combining diagnostics, intervention, behavior, and insight.
It anchors the user in the Zennya ecosystem while proving tangible results through a self-reinforcing feedback system.
This is not a sleep product. It’s a programmable sleep improvement engine.
2. Target Outcomes
3. Inputs & Triggers
Required Inputs:
Zennya Ring Data:
Sleep architecture (REM, deep, latency)
Heart rate, HRV
Body temperature
Step count + intensity tiers
Time in bed vs time asleep
Baseline Labs:
Cortisol, glucose, magnesium, Vit D, thyroid panel
Behavioral Intake:
Caffeine/alcohol use, device usage, sleep timing, exercise timing
Intervention Compliance:
Supplement intake (manual or timestamped)
IV therapy (appointment + effect window)
User Experience Improved sleep score (REM %, deep %, latency)
Biometric Reduced cortisol, stabilized glucose, improved HRV
Behavioral Increased compliance to recommended rituals (supplements,
steps, IVs, timing adherence)
Engagement Higher service repeat rate, ring retention, multi-stack conversion
Domain Objective

Massage (timing, feedback)
Trigger Logic:
5 days of low sleep score OR non-REM/Deep imbalance
Presence of cortisol dysregulation or magnesium deficiency
Self-reported fatigue, mood swings, or concentration issues
Overtraining risk signals (HRV drop + intense training + poor sleep)
4. Intervention Stack (Tiered)
5. Feedback, Insight, and Closure
Core Loops:
Daily:
Ring → Sleep score
Supplement or ritual compliance → App check
Nudges issued based on missed steps, late workouts, caffeine intake
Weekly:
Pattern summaries:
“REM sleep was highest on days you exceeded 7,000 steps and avoided caffeine after 2PM.”
Monthly:
Ring + Lab data reconciliation
Dynamic protocol adjustment
Automated Insights (examples):
“Deep sleep increased 18% during the week you received IV magnesium on Monday and Friday.”
Tier 1 – Baseline Rituals Supplements Melatonin, magnesium glycinate, L-
theanine, adaptogens
Step goal assignment 6k–10k/day targets based on baseline
Sleep digital ritual Evening content, timing reminders
Tier 2 – Reinforcing Interventions IV therapy Magnesium sulfate, NAD, glutathione,
taurine
Massage Sleep-focused treatment (timed <2 hours
before bed)
Tier 3 – Programmatic Evaluation Lab recheck Validate effect of interventions on
biomarkers
Telehealth consult Update protocol with MD + AI review
Expanded testing Thyroid, sex hormones, inflammation
panel (if poor responders)
Tier Modality Description

“REM dropped consistently after evening workouts. Recommend adjusting to morning.”
“On days you walked 8k+ steps and took ashwagandha, latency improved by 22 minutes.”
6. Ritual Engineering
7. GTM Architecture
Value Framing:
“Sleep isn’t a mystery anymore. It’s a measurable system. We help you improve it.”
“Your sleep stack adapts to you—not the other way around.”
Bundles:
Funnel:
Ad → Outcome (e.g., “You’re not sleeping badly. You’re missing the right rituals.”)
Lead → Intake quiz + behavioral flags
Offer → Personalized Stack
Conversion → Ring delivery → Labs scheduled → Rituals onboarded
8. Automation & LLM Hooks
Temporal Reinforcement Evening rituals guided by Ring + App notifications (based on
circadian target window)
Behavioral Hooks Step streaks, pre-sleep digital decompression guidance, guided
supplement reminders
Psychological Anchors Personalized data stories, visible gains in REM/deep %, weekly
ritual reports
Habit Resilience “Fallback” suggestions after missed interventions; sleep resilience
coaching scripts
Layer Design Feature

personal AI timeline
Bio-optimizers, longevity crowd
Tier Components Target
Insight Generation “Generate weekly pattern summary for user based on Ring + IV
logs + steps”
Agent Use Case Trigger

Support “Explain why IV magnesium was added to user’s protocol after
poor deep sleep trend”
Personalization “Based on missed supplements and late workouts, recommend
adjusted ritual schedule”
Scripted Follow-Up “Send compliance follow-up if user has missed 3+ rituals in a
week”
