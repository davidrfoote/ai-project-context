Zennya Operating Model
1. Business Model & Revenue Composition
Zennya’s revenue model blends wellness services, medical care delivery, and an emerging product ecosystem into a multi-modal platform
monetization strategy. As of recent quarters:
~$280K USD monthly revenue, composed of:
$200–210K (70–75%) from wellness (primarily massage)
$70–80K (25–30%) from medical services (split evenly between B2B HMO work and B2C medical bookings)
$1K from telehealth (currently marginal but strategic for ecosystem lock-in)
Zennya Essentials (excluded from the $280K core): currently $20K/month with 100% MoM growth
Gross Margin Insights
Blended margin: ~30%
Wellness: Highest margin, lowest operational complexity, highest repeat frequency. Revenue per hour: ~PHP 700; provider cost: PHP
250–300
B2B Medical: Lowest margin. PHP 750 per job admin fee with PHP 300 to nurse, ~PHP 150 logistics cost, and additional medical
consumables
Strategic Leveraging: High-margin, scalable products (Essentials, Ring, Smart Sleep) are margin-expanding and allow brand
amplification + acquisition without further service-side scale dependency.
2. Service Stack Structure
Zennya operates an integrated service stack, designed to function as an end-to-end health operating system:
Wellness Layer: Massage, therapy, balms, oils — ritualized, high-frequency, behavior-anchoring
Medical Diagnostics: Blood draws, lab processing, vital collection — routed via Zennya’s logistics engine
Medical Interventions: IV drips, injectables, medication support — clinical-grade delivery at home
Digital Health Layer: Sleep scoring, biometric tracking, programmatic health (sleep, stress, recovery)
Telehealth Layer: Physician consults integrated with diagnostics and wearable data
Consumer Products: Zennya Essentials, Zennya Ring — ritual anchors and biometric data capture
Each service layer feeds a closed feedback loop: Input → Insight → Intervention → Feedback.
3. Workforce Model
Zennya operates a multi-tiered gig workforce optimized for specialization and tech-enhanced onboarding:
Therapists (Wellness): Trained from zero using Zennya’s proprietary learning platform; gamified progression ladder; continuous
feedback loop from client reviews
Nurses & Med Techs (Medical): Must hold PRC ID; trained in Zennya’s specific service protocols, safety, and delivery model
Drivers (Logistics): Gig-based, app-routed; optimize travel time and cross-job coordination

Kitters (Ops & Fulfillment): App-guided gig workers responsible for inventory prep, cleaning, and assembly (kits, wellness goods,
etc.)
The workforce engine is a core strength: tech-enabled labor transformation, turning raw applicants into standardized, high-performance
providers within weeks.
4. Supply Chain & Fulfillment Engine
Zennya controls core aspects of manufacturing, inventory, and logistics to ensure reliability, quality, and vertical leverage.
Product Manufacturing: In-house production of wellness goods (balms, oils, soaps) using primarily locally sourced, organic materials.
Key imports: essential oils (Thailand), diffusers (China)
Distribution: Managed from multi-hub system:
Primary hubs: 300–400 sqm
Satellite hubs: 100–200 sqm
Cold Chain: Maintained via pharmaceutical-grade refrigeration and IoT temperature monitoring (Estimates sensors). Kits and
consumables optimized for clinical compliance
Zennya’s physical footprint is designed for horizontal and vertical scalability.
5. Subscription vs On-Demand Logic
Zennya supports a hybrid model:
On-Demand: Core of wellness and B2C medical usage today; preferred by price-sensitive or episodic users
Subscription & Bundles: Strategic growth path—anchored by Smart Sleep, Ring + Diagnostics + Monthly Consults
Current market behavior in PH is cautious toward subscriptions, but high LTV can be achieved by framing these as high-trust, high-
reward ritual programs. The subscription layer also improves operational predictability, supports inventory planning, and provides strong
upsell/cross-sell anchors.
Zennya’s operating model is designed for platform scale: combining infrastructure control, behavioral productization, workforce leverage,
and closed-loop feedback. The result is a health delivery model that is uniquely suited for Southeast Asia’s cultural, infrastructural, and
economic realities.
