Zennya Tech & Infrastructure
1. Platform Architecture Overview
Zennya operates as a modular, vertically integrated health infrastructure stack designed to deliver diagnostics, wellness,
interventions, and behaviorally reinforced outcomes across a mobile-first ecosystem.
Core Architectural Layers:
Experience Layer: Zennya mobile app (iOS/Android), telehealth UI, provider app (routing, feedback, job detail), user dashboards, e-
commerce layer (Essentials)
Intelligence Layer: Sleep scoring engine, biometric analytics, intervention recommender, health scoring models, user clustering
algorithms
Service Orchestration Layer: Booking engine, dynamic real-time/on-demand and scheduled routing engine, provider matching, task
allocation
Data Integration Layer: Wearable sync (Ring), lab result ingestion (structured data and PDFs), Bluetooth medical devices (BP
monitors, SpO2, temp, weight)
Operations Infrastructure: Custom-built EMR, logistics tracking, inventory control, app-based SOPs for providers and kitters
2. App Ecosystem
Zennya’s apps form the primary control surface for both service delivery and user engagement:
Client App: Bookings, health dashboards, program enrollment, sleep + vitals insights, product ordering (Ring, Essentials)
Provider App: Schedule view, routing maps, job protocols, feedback capture, supply checklists
Internal Ops Layer: Admin panel, service orchestration dashboard, inventory and supply chain module, workforce training analytics
All apps are developed in-house to preserve UX control, enable iteration speed, and unify the behavioral and clinical delivery design.
3. Wearables & Medical Device Integration
Zennya supports a growing range of health data inputs:
Zennya Ring: Core biometric device used for Smart Sleep; syncs periodically through user interaction with app
Bluetooth Devices: BP monitor, thermometer, SpO2 meter, weight/body comp scales; primarily used during in-home medical jobs by
trained providers
Integration Mode: Local device pairing with provider or user app; data routed into the user timeline and analyzed within the biometric
engine
No third-party consumer APIs (e.g., Fitbit, Apple Health) are currently supported.
4. Data & EMR Framework
Zennya operates a custom-built, mobile-optimized EMR designed for:
Time-series health and biometric data

Diagnostic data (stored as structured lab fields and PDFs)
Freeform and templated physician notes (non-SOAP)
Telehealth coordination and internal QA workflow
Data access is permissioned by role and secured under encrypted storage protocols.
5. Logistics & Cold Chain Tech
Zennya’s logistics engine ensures reliable, compliant delivery of time- and temperature-sensitive services:
Routing Engine: Fully automated, accounts for on-demand jobs, advanced bookings, and training schedules simultaneously
Cold Chain: Pharma-grade refrigeration in primary hubs, IoT monitoring with Estimates sensors, logs temp per kit per delivery route
Hub Model: Multiple facilities (300–400 sqm primary, 100–200 sqm satellite) for service prep, product fulfillment, and inventory
management
6. Training, QA, and Protocol Management
Training and execution quality are enforced and evolved through Zennya’s tech stack:
Training Stack: App-based modules, gamified ladder, skill assignment based on crowdsourced job scores, number of completed jobs,
and tracked behavioral metrics (humility, learning interest, reliability)
Automated Progression: Promotions and new skill invitations are metrics-based; underperforming providers may be paused (3-strike
system) and reactivated after corrective training/offline reset periods
QA & SOPs: Real-time feedback, randomized audits, embedded service protocols auto-surfaced by job type
7. Partner Integrations & Data Interfaces
Zennya supports both API-driven and web-based partner interfaces, depending on external capabilities:
Lab & HMO Partner Interfaces: Partners use Zennya’s software via web portals to place and manage orders
API Integrations: Available and used by labs with technical capacity for paperless diagnostics and specimen processing; limited HMO
usage to date
Data Export & Sharing: Encrypted summaries and records made available to users, physicians, and integrated partners per access
permissions
Zennya’s infrastructure is designed not just for scale—but for insight propagation, behavior change, and medical reliability across
fragmented regional ecosystems
