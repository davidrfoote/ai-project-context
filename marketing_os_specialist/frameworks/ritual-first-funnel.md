# Ritual-First Funnel Design
## Behavioral Architecture • Growth Mechanics • Ecosystem Progression

## 1. Funnel Philosophy

```yaml
ritual_vs_traditional:
  traditional_funnel:
    stages: [awareness, interest, desire, action]
    focus: "transaction_completion"
    success: "purchase_made"
    optimization: "conversion_rate"
    
  zennya_ritual_funnel:
    stages: [discovery, onboarding, activation, retention, expansion]
    focus: "behavior_adoption"
    success: "ritual_established"
    optimization: "adherence_rate"
    
  core_principle: "ritual_over_transaction"
```

## 2. Funnel Architecture

```yaml
funnel_layers:
  discovery:
    channels: [meta_ads, podcasts, app_cross_promotion, influencer_seeding]
    focus: "problem_identification"
    metrics: "engagement_quality_over_volume"
    revenue_impact: "$280K_monthly (70%_wellness, 30%_medical)"
    
  onboarding:
    flow: "waitlist_quiz → data_capture → smart_offer"
    personalization: "ring_only_vs_stack_recommendation"
    pricing: "ring_$200-250_gateway"
    metrics: "completion_quality_not_conversion"
    
  activation:
    sequence: "ring_delivery → lab_appointment → intervention_push"
    focus: "first_ritual_completion"
    smart_stack: "ring + baseline_labs + tiered_interventions"
    metrics: "time_to_first_ritual"
    
  retention:
    touchpoints: "daily_app → sleep_score → insight_nudges → service_reactivation"
    tiered_interventions:
      tier_1: [supplements, step_goals, digital_rituals]
      tier_2: [iv_therapy, massage_therapy]
      tier_3: [lab_rechecks, telehealth, expanded_testing]
    metrics: "ritual_completion_rate"
    
  expansion:
    triggers: "biometric_signals + compliance_patterns"
    approach: "evidence_based_not_pressure"
    b2b_complement: "hmo_partnerships"
    metrics: "health_outcome_amplification"
```

  recovery_patterns:
    condition: "post_workout_detected"
    action: "iv_drip_suggestion"
    
  stress_indicators:
    condition: "high_stress + poor_sleep"
    action: "massage_supplement_combo"
    
  hrv_patterns:
    condition: "low_hrv_trend"
    action: "recovery_protocol_education"
    
  implementation:
    - real_time_processing
    - behavioral_segmentation
    - contextual_recommendations
    - multi_channel_delivery

```

## 6. Product-Led Growth

```yaml

  success_metrics:
    primary: [ritual_adoption_rate, consistency_score, health_outcomes]

```

## 10. Growth Projections
