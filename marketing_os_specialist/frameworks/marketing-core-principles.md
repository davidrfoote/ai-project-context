# Marketing Core Principles
## Trust Architecture • Brand Voice • Ethical Framework • Messaging Hierarchy

## 1. Trust Equation & Architecture

```yaml
trust_equation:
  formula: "Trust = Source × Process × Result"
  components:
    source: [origin_transparency, quality_verification, expertise_validation]
    process: [manufacturing_standards, testing_protocols, delivery_integrity]
    result: [outcome_measurement, timeline_accuracy, comparison_validity]
  
marketing_trust:
  formula: "Marketing_Trust = Claim_Integrity × Delivery_Consistency × Result_Transparency"
  requirements:
    - empirically_verifiable_claims
    - measurable_intervention_effects
    - delivery_capability_connection
    - accurate_experience_representation
```

### Trust Implementation Matrix

| Dimension | Consumer Products | Clinical Services | B2B Partnerships |
|-----------|------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Credibility | 3rd-party testing, ingredient sourcing | Medical oversight, licensed providers | Performance guarantees, case studies |
| Reliability | Batch consistency, expiry dating | Service standards, appointment access | SLA adherence, outcome tracking |
| Intimacy | Personalization, cultural respect | Individual care plans, privacy | Dedicated support, co-development |

## 2. Brand Voice Framework

```yaml
voice_attributes:
  professional:
    definition: "Evidence-rooted, not performative"
    implementation: [clinical_authority, grounded_claims, medical_accuracy]
  
  plainspoken:
    definition: "Complexity removed without dumbing down"
    avoid: [jargon, euphemisms, ai_theater]
    
  compassionate:
    definition: "Patient-centered and empathetic"
    implementation: [no_prior_knowledge_assumed, fear_free, supportive]
    
  accountable:
    definition: "Ownership without deflection"
    implementation: [acknowledge_issues, provide_solutions, follow_through]
```

## 3. Messaging Hierarchy

```yaml
messaging_structure:
  hierarchy: [outcome, evidence, feature, vision]
  
  templates:
    outcome:
      consumer: "Achieve [specific_benefit] in [timeframe]"
      clinical: "Improve [health_marker] by [percentage]"
      b2b: "Reduce [cost/risk] while improving [metric]"
    
    evidence:
      consumer: "Validated with [number]+ users"
      clinical: "Based on [study/protocol] showing [result]"
      b2b: "[percentage] improvement in [business_metric]"
    
    feature:
      format: "lowercase product name + key ingredients/components"
      
    vision:
      approach: "emergent_not_stated"
      implementation: "subtle_ecosystem_references"
```

### Channel-Specific Adaptations

```yaml
channel_adaptations:
  packaging:
    depth: simplified
    focus: outcome_clarity
    evidence: single_validation_point
    
  website:
    depth: comprehensive
    focus: trust_building
    evidence: multiple_proof_points
    
  email:
    depth: progressive
    focus: ritual_reinforcement
    evidence: personalized_data
```

## 4. Ethical Marketing Framework

```yaml
ethical_non_negotiables:
  prohibited:
    - false_urgency: ["limited_time", "only_x_left", "price_expires"]
    - dark_patterns: ["hidden_fees", "forced_continuity", "shame_tactics"]
    - fear_marketing: ["health_anxiety", "crisis_exploitation", "fomo"]
    - manipulation: ["fake_social_proof", "misleading_testimonials", "bait_switch"]
  
  required:
    - transparent_pricing: [full_cost_visible, cancellation_ease, renewal_clarity]
    - honest_claims: [evidence_backed, realistic_timelines, individual_variation]
    - user_control: [data_export, preference_respect, easy_opt_out]
```

### Trust Recovery Protocol

```yaml
trust_gap_response:
  steps:
    1: acknowledge_immediately
    2: explain_root_cause
    3: detail_solution
    4: implement_system_fix
    5: follow_up_confirmation
  
  timeline: 
    initial_response: "<24_hours"
    solution_implementation: "<7_days"
    follow_up: "30_days"
```

## 5. Cultural Adaptation Framework

```yaml
cultural_voice_adaptations:
  philippines:
    language_integration: 
      approach: "professional_english_primary"
      implementation: [clear_medical_terminology, accessible_explanations]
    family_context: "collective_benefit_emphasis"
    trust_building: "evidence_based_testimonials"
    
  usa_exploratory:
    approach: "clinical_authority"
    values: [individual_optimization, data_driven_outcomes]
    trust_building: "research_citations"
    
  general_approach:
    focus: "evidence_based_health"
    values: [measurable_outcomes, professional_credibility, clinical_standards]
```

## 6. Performance Marketing Guidelines

```yaml
paid_acquisition_ethics:
  targeting:
    allowed: [need_based, behavior_based, interest_based]
    prohibited: [vulnerability_based, medical_condition, crisis_moment]
    
  creative_standards:
    required: [accurate_representation, evidence_included, clear_terms]
    prohibited: [exaggerated_claims, fake_urgency, misleading_imagery]
    
  landing_pages:
    alignment: "must_match_ad_promise"
    transparency: "full_pricing_visible"
    trust_elements: [credentials, testimonials, guarantees]
```

## 7. Ritual-First Marketing

```yaml
ritual_optimization_metrics:
  primary: 
    - ritual_adoption_rate: "completed_rituals / recommended_rituals"
    - consistency_score: "consecutive_days_completed / total_days"
    - expansion_rate: "additional_rituals_adopted / initial_ritual"
    
  vs_traditional:
    traditional_cro: [conversion_rate, cart_value, session_time]
    ritual_optimization: [adoption_rate, completion_consistency, health_outcomes]
```

### Ritual Language Patterns

```yaml
ritual_language:
  strong_patterns:
    - "Complete your [timeframe] [protocol_name]"
    - "Your [ritual_name] guided by [data/evidence]"
    - "Daily rituals designed for [outcome]"
    
  avoid_patterns:
    - transaction_focused: ["buy_now", "order_today", "purchase"]
    - one_time_language: ["try", "test", "sample"]
    - quick_fix_messaging: ["instant", "immediate", "overnight"]
```
