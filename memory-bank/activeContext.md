# Active Context - Current Work Focus

## Current Session Focus
Setting up Cline Memory Bank for the AI Project Context repository to maintain persistent context across development sessions.

## Recent Changes
1. **Git Repository Initialized**: Successfully pushed to GitHub at https://github.com/davidrfoote/ai-project-context
2. **Jarvis MCP Architect v2.0**: Major update to implementation-focused system prompt
   - Added bias awareness and self-correction triggers
   - Shifted from planning/design to faithful implementation
   - Emphasized natural language interface over explicit configuration
3. **Memory Bank Setup**: Currently creating Memory Bank structure for project context

## Active Decisions

### Documentation Strategy
- Using Cline Memory Bank methodology for persistent context
- Maintaining both Claude Projects compatibility and Cline integration
- Focusing on clarity and token efficiency

### Revision Priorities
1. Optimize specialists for token efficiency without sacrificing functionality
2. Ensure consistency across all specialists
3. Improve framework organization and reduce redundancy
4. Enhance cross-system compatibility

## Important Patterns

### Specialist Structure
```
specialist_name/
├── manifest.json       # Metadata and configuration
├── system_prompt.md    # Behavioral instructions
└── frameworks/         # Domain knowledge files
```

### Git Workflow
- Make changes locally
- Test with Claude/Cline
- Commit with descriptive messages
- Push to GitHub for version control

## Current Insights

### Token Optimization
- File count doesn't matter for Claude Projects
- Focus on content quality over compression
- System prompts should be comprehensive but concise
- Framework files provide depth without bloating main prompt

### Cross-System Design
- Specialists should work in both Claude Projects and Cline
- Memory Bank provides project-specific context
- Specialists provide domain-specific expertise
- Both systems complement each other

## Next Steps
1. Complete Memory Bank setup with remaining files
2. Create .clinerules file with Memory Bank instructions
3. Review and optimize each specialist for consistency
4. Test specialists in both Claude Projects and Cline contexts
5. Document best practices for using specialists across systems

## Questions to Resolve
- How to best structure framework files for dual-use (Claude Projects + Cline)
- Whether to add Memory Bank awareness to specialist prompts
- Optimal token budget per specialist for Claude Projects
