Zennya Brand Ethos & Communication Style
Zennya Brand Ethos & Communication Style
Tone Canon • Messaging Architecture • Visual Language • LLM-Ready Reference
1. Tone of Voice
Zennya speaks plainly, professionally, and compassionately.
Zennya doesn’t try to sound smart. We work to make health feel safe, understandable, and actionable.
2. Messaging Hierarchy
Zennya does not lead with vision. We lead with value delivered—clarity, trust, outcomes.
📐 Order of Communication
1. Outcome → What problem is solved? What benefit is felt?
2. Evidence → What data, protocol, or feedback supports it?
3. Feature → What is the user interacting with?
4. Vision (emergent) → Let users draw the conclusion that Zennya is different.
✅ Examples
“Better sleep backed by your own data. Not claims.”
“Real diagnostics, delivered at home. Interpreted by humans and AI.”
“IVs that actually change your lab results. Not your hydration status.”
3. Cultural & Emotional Aesthetics
Zennya embodies Apple precision with Ayurvedic emotional intelligence.
Professional Rooted in evidence, not performance. We speak with clinical
authority—grounded, not grandiose.
Plainspoken We remove complexity without dumbing things down. No jargon.
No euphemisms. No AI theater.
Compassionate We speak to patients, not systems. Our language is patient-
centered, empathetic, and assumes no prior knowledge.
Accountable We take ownership. We never deflect. If something went wrong,
we say so and fix it.
Attribute Description
Dimension Ethos

4. Visual Design Anchors
Zennya’s aesthetic supports trust, not trend.
5. Positioning: What We Are / What We Are Not
Emotional Feel Grounded, calm, confident, direct. We never shout. We don’t sell
fear.
Cultural Signals Respectful tone, minimal visual noise, authority without
intimidation
Patient Vibe Cared for, understood, and guided—not talked down to or
overwhelmed
Brand Energy Quiet confidence. We don’t “aspire”—we deliver, measure, and
improve.
Values Expressed Clinical integrity, human connection, transparent design, low-
friction UX
Core Fonts Helvetica Neue (interface clarity), Brandon Grotesque (editorial
warmth)
Color Palette Healthcare neutrals and deep tones—blues, teals, purples. Clean
gradients.
Mode Adaptation Dark mode and light mode are context-driven, never purely
aesthetic
Iconography Minimal, symbolic, never decorative. Icons must clarify, not
decorate.
Imagery Style Real people when applicable, no stock health clichés. Clean,
quiet, modern backdrops.
Movement Subtle, intentional, never animated for the sake of motion. Actions
feel deliberate and reassuring.

LLM Prompts Always reference “tone: plainspoken, clinical authority,
compassionate.” Never write in jargon or hype.
Internal UX Copy Write like a clinician who cares and explains—never as a brand
trying to impress.
Marketing Copy Outcomes > Evidence > Features. Let trust emerge through the
interface and the story.
Support Language Default to clarity and accountability. Never use euphemisms.
Never deflect. Speak like a real person.
Bot/AI Agent Responses “You’re in control. Here’s what we know. Here’s what we
recommend. You can decide.” Always give reasoning with
options.
