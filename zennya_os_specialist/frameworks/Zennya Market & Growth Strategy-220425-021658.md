Zennya Market & Growth Strategy
Funnel Design • Trojan GTM Tactics • Cultural Embedding • Network Effects
1. B2C Funnel Strategy
Zennya's consumer funnel is not ad-first or CAC-driven. It is ritual-first, trust-driven, and designed for:
Organic adoption through service excellence
Embedded discovery via app interface, rituals, and product use
Paid amplification through meta channels only after system feedback validates narrative resonance
Funnel Layering (Current → Future):
The funnel is not a series of pages—it is a ritual loop that gains fidelity with every data point.
2. Waitlist Strategy
The waitlist is not a scarcity tactic—it’s a signal-gathering system and pre-funnel engine.
Objectives:
Map intent across:
Ring-only vs Full Stack
Sleep vs stress vs performance motivation
Measure market size per stack before inventory / ad spend
Capture UX questions and objections in real time (to train support flows and LLMs)
Pre-segment high-interest users for early access campaigns and founder-touch moments
Key Tactics:
Segment at sign-up: “What’s your main goal with sleep?”
Discovery Meta ads, wellness podcasts, app cross-promotion (e.g.,
massage → sleep ring), influencer seeding
Onboarding Waitlist quiz → data capture → smart offer (Ring-only vs Stack)
Activation Ring delivery → Lab appointment → Intervention ritual push
Retention Daily app engagement via sleep score, insight nudges,
IV/massage reactivation
Expansion Cross-stack upgrade suggestions based on biometric or
compliance signal
Funnel Stage Action

Smart drip: Based on goal + segment → deliver layered content + invite to onboard
Early access: No payment → opt-in conversion window later
No false urgency: Trust is core—Zennya avoids fake countdowns or manipulation
3. Pricing Framework
💡 Philosophy:
Zennya pricing signals trust and benevolence, not lock-in or predatory tactics.
We never create pricing mechanisms that exploit forgetfulness or confusion. If it feels like a “gotcha,” it doesn’t belong in healthcare.
4. B2B / HMO Channel Roadmap
Zennya treats B2B as a density multiplier, not a sales channel.
Current State:
Co-branded partnerships with HMOs
Zennya providers act as last-mile extension of existing clinical workflows
Strategic Roles:
Free CAC: B2B feeds consumer funnel via provider exposure
Network Density: Higher job density → lower unit logistics cost → stronger fulfillment infrastructure
Brand Legitimacy: HMO adoption signals credibility to upper-market consumers
Data Expansion: More labs, more specimens, more API-connected health events
Go-Forward Plays:
Zennya Ring Aggressive pricing (~$200–250) Trojan entry point to ecosystem. The ring
is not the business—it is the gateway.
Sleep Stack Bundled logic (Ring + Labs + Rituals) Pricing based on perceived transformation,
not feature stacking
IV/Diagnostics Pay-as-you-go with continuity nudges Subscriptions optional and opt-in—not
forced trials
Massage/Wellness Transparent pricing, repeat-friendly Upfront, predictable, loyalty-based not
gamified
Product Price Approach Justification
Insurers Zennya Ring embedded into preventive care plan only after
flagship product wins—insurers must chase us, not dilute us
Employers Curated sleep/stress stacks for C-level wellness programs—used
as aspirational tools, not compliance checklists
Channel Strategy

5. Cultural Inescapability Tactics
Zennya will become inescapable not through ads—but through integration into aspirational lifestyle systems.
Embedded Playbook:
Partner with Filipino wellness thought leaders, athletes, CEOs
Public presence at high-trust intersections: top salons, boutique gyms, functional medicine conferences
Storytelling through user transformation, not founder claims
Feature depth, not virality: product is the message
Clinics White-labeled infrastructure licensing (Zennya OS), never
aggregator or pass-through execution
Home Zennya diffuser on shelf, Zennya supplements by bedside,
massage in evening ritual
Body Zennya Ring on hand, recognized as signal of belonging to
performance-first culture
App Zennya dashboard checked daily, guiding behavior with insights
and micro-decisions
Language “What’s your Zennya protocol?” becomes vernacular in elite
health circles
Brand Equity Positioned as the Apple of Health Rituals—clean, intelligent, non-
fragmented, self-reinforcing
