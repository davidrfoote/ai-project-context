Zennya Company Profile
1. Origin Story & Founder Intent
Zennya was conceived as a platform-level intervention to address systemic dysfunction in Southeast Asia’s healthcare and wellness
delivery. The founder, with dual-domain expertise in neurobiology and computer science, identified a critical gap: the region lacked a
scalable, precision-driven system capable of merging clinical-grade health services with real-time logistics, personalized data, and
behavioral design.
The objective was never to build a services company. The intent from inception was to architect a modular infrastructure—one that could
ingest diagnostic inputs, route interventions, and evolve continuously via closed-loop data feedback. Zennya's founding philosophy: health
should be on-demand, high-trust, and integrated into daily life, not abstracted into hospitals, bureaucracy, or marketing gimmicks.
2. Functional Overview
Zennya is a tech-enabled, vertically integrated health operating system, delivering programmatic care, diagnostics, interventions, and
wellness services through a mobile-first interface.
Service Stack
Diagnostics: In-home blood draws, sample logistics, lab integrations (Tier-1 labs in PH)
Programmatic Care: Sleep, weight, hormone, and stress optimization using wearables + labs + AI-driven coaching
Medical Interventions: IV drips (NAD, Glutathione, Vitamin C), injections, vital sign collection, chronic care support
Telehealth: EMR-integrated virtual consults with licensed physicians, embedded in the app
Wellness Layer: Medical massage, physical therapy, essential oils, sensory design integration
Product Ecosystem
Zennya Ring: Wearable sensor platform to drive longitudinal biometric feedback and health scoring. Acts as a biometric gateway for
the Smart Sleep and broader programmatic stack.
Zennya Essentials: Sensory and ritual companion to the platform. Includes manufactured line of essential oils, balms, candles, and
soaps—formulated to align with health interventions (e.g., sleep, energy, stress recovery). Essentials are integrated into care plans
(e.g., scent-based priming for sleep), and also sold through direct-to-consumer channels (Shopee, Lazada) via a JV structure: Zennya
handles product design, sourcing, and manufacturing; partners handle ecommerce and marketing. Essentials is not a lifestyle brand—it
is a biometric-aligned, protocol-supportive extension of the core OS.
Modalities: Biometric analysis → Insight generation → At-home intervention (physical/digital) → Feedback capture
3. Geographic Operating Footprint
Philippines
Primary market. Operations concentrated in Metro Manila and Cebu. Deep penetration into high-income urban consumer base. Strong
regulatory and lab partner integration. Home-grown workforce.
Thailand
Early-stage market with focus on wellness/massage. Gateway for expansion via medical tourism, cross-border care, and premium

concierge health services.
United States
Exploratory. Focus on cross-border users, potential remote care integrations, and future product partnerships (not operationally core).
4. Organizational and Business Scale
Users Served: >100,000 unique app users
Service Volume: >1,000,000 at-home jobs completed
Monthly Gross Revenue: ~$280K USD
Gross Margin: ~30%, with optimization ongoing via supply chain and product mix
Labor Force: ~400 active licensed gig providers (nurses, med techs, therapists, drivers)
Internal Headcount: <10 core employees across ops, engineering, product, and CX
Capitalization: $2.7M raised via KISS notes; valuation cap: $12M; cap table founder-heavy (>95% common stock held by founder)
5. SEA Market & Cultural Landscape
Southeast Asia exhibits:
Infrastructure Gaps: Public healthcare is underfunded and unreliable; private care is expensive and inconvenient
Behavioral Gaps: Preventive care is underutilized; wellness is fragmented across massage, self-medication, and pseudoscience
Cultural Dynamics: Trust is reputation-based, not institutional. Consumers are mobile-first but healthcare-averse until symptomatic.
Wellness is emotionally driven, not data-driven.
Zennya capitalizes by delivering:
Infrastructure Substitution: Platform-level replacement for clinics, labs, and fragmented wellness centers
Service Layer Unification: Diagnostics + Interventions + Tracking + Coaching in one system
Premiumization with Trust: Medical-grade care, professionalized wellness, culturally relevant delivery
The result: Zennya becomes the de facto interface for health and wellness in urban SEA, beginning with sleep and diagnostics, and
expanding across the full spectrum of human optimization.
