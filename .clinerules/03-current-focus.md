# Current Focus - Repository Reorganization

## Active Session Goals
1. **Repository Structure Cleanup**: Moving from flat structure to organized `specialists/` directory
2. **Cline Rules Upgrade**: Converting single `.clinerules` file to folder-based system
3. **Path Updates**: Updating any references to new specialist locations

## Current Task
Reorganizing the AI Project Context repository for better structure and maintainability:

### From (Current):
```
ai-project-context/
├── .clinerules (single file)
├── registry.json
├── jarvis_mcp_architect/
├── marketing_os_specialist/
├── prompt_specialist/
└── zennya_os_specialist/
```

### To (Target):
```
ai-project-context/
├── .clinerules/ (folder with multiple files)
├── memory-bank/
├── specialists/
│   ├── registry.json
│   ├── jarvis_mcp_architect/
│   ├── marketing_os_specialist/
│   ├── prompt_specialist/
│   └── zennya_os_specialist/
```

## Completed Steps ✓
1. ✅ Created `specialists/` directory
2. ✅ Moved all specialist folders and registry.json
3. ✅ Updated path references in README and Memory Bank
4. ✅ Tested the new structure
5. ✅ Committed reorganization to Git

## Next Steps
1. Test .clinerules folder system functionality
2. Begin specialist optimization and consistency review
3. Document usage patterns for new structure
4. Create guidelines for future specialist development

## Quality Checks
- Ensure all specialists remain functional
- Verify registry.json paths are updated if needed
- Test that Memory Bank still works correctly
- Confirm Git tracking is maintained
